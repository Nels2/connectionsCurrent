# connectionsCurrent
This started as a offline project for my company, but have since removed all references to it, and uploading here as a back up.

# What this script does (beta.ps1)
To start, there is a power point(connectionsCurrent) that is basically just current events for the day. This is a little project that I started for my company because they wanted a powerpoint to run on a set of displays. They also wanted the power point to switch to current day once a new one has been made and stored in a specific network share.
- First it compares hashes / date last touched of network share version(FakeNetworkShare) and local version.
- Next, if the files are different, it copies over the new file(a *.pps file*) to local dir.
- Then displays said .pps file from the local dir(FakeLocalDirectory). 
- runs on a loop that just repeats above.
# a little more information...
- Set up 'script.bat' under task scheduler to run with the highest privileges for your desired time.
- If this is going to replicated for some reason by someone else for testing purposes, make sure the directory 'FakeNetworkShare' has been set up as a network share via windows properties.
- You will *need* to set up a dummy user for sharepoint that has read-only access for the directory you are grabbing the file from.
- The same dummy user mentioned above needs to have access to Powerpoint/Office and you will **need** to sign into the **machine running the script & accept the license agreement.** -- *skipping this usually won't let the powerpoint run.
- You *should* set up a dummy local windows log-in user that has no password and auto logs in.
# How to set this up...
- Copy 'connectionsCurrent' into C:/.
- Add script to windows start up & desktop.. explained further below (*setting up script to run from start-up*)
- Login into OneDrive from taskbar. (has to have access to whatever network drive that is going to be used obviously)
- Run Script by creating a shortcut of 'script.bat' and placing it on desktop from the 'Scripts' folder. Make sure that it has been set to ALWAYS run with admin rights via properties -> advanced -> Run as Admin. 
## Setting up script to run from start-up:
- Press Win + R
- Type in: shell:startup
- Take 'script.bat' from Script folder and place on **desktop** as well **startup folder**.
## You should be free to restart and the script will display the power point upon login
## * - depending on your hard drive and start up apps the time it takes to start may take a couple seconds.
